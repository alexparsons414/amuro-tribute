          <p><i>"There are just some things you don’t understand. Revolutions are dreamt up by intellectuals, but their aims are so unrealistic that they’ll steep to drastic measures. Following the revolution, the worthy passions for rebirth are swallowed up by bureaucracy and mediocrity. Intellectuals hate this and withdraw from society and politics and become recluses!"<br><br></i></p><p id='author'><i>--Amuro Ray<br>From <a id='tribute-link' href='https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/G9DUE1MQ5/mobile-suit-gundam-chars-counterattack' target='_blank'>Char's Counterattack</a></i></p>
